            <h1>Blocking Behaviours</h1>
            <p><a href="http://bjarni-gunnarsson.net" target="_blank">Bjarni Gunnarsson</a></p>
            
            <p>This exposition reflects on composing computer music using generative processes and simulations that are based on rules and interaction between simple components. The aim is to develop complex behaviour, systems that self-organize and adapt. Artificial environments that can be observed and followed. This point of view touches on reviewing algorithms, agency, simulations and the becoming of sound processes. It questions the scope and potential boundaries of simulations through the creative space relating compositional practice with observation and the development of artificial environments.
            </p>

            <p>Running the simulations becomes the carrier of my composition and research approach. They introduce a way of thinking through change and complex behaviour that consider musical output as something that emerges from the interaction with an autonomous system. With generative, rule-based systems, evolving algorithms can be set in motion where a creator/composer becomes an observer of various behaviours that can't always be controlled to the detail. Building upon the act of observation as a mode of composition is what drives many of the practical applications.
            </p>

            <p>
              The research also questions possible modes of interaction with digital systems. Instead of allowing for control of the simulations after they have been set in motion, the main interaction is by blocking them or disturbing their desired flow. The observer attaches any sound-producing algorithms to the simulations that take place so that the music that results is an interpretation of it. The interaction of forcing a rule-based system by interrupting operations instead of controlling interactions.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The exposition will be a document on the Research Catalogue. It will include audio and video examples of the simulations and the music that occurs when interacting with them. It will outline, reflect and comment on the process of developing the simulations and the act of using them in a musical context. It will also include a theoretical aspect that considers structural coupling, experimental systems, black boxes and what constitutes a living computable medium.

            <h2>Medium
              <small "style">Computational material</small>
            </h2>
            </ol>
            <p>An important question is how to think through the influence of an algorithmic medium and the enclosing conditions from which it emerges. This issue is stressed by Wegner and Goldin in discussing the “interaction with an external world”[1] where surrounding dynamics are found to be more important than the computed results. Given a clearly defined set of resources, a variety of processes can operate within the boundaries imposed by a certain context. Such a shared space can be seen as a composable structure, a medium where both composition and observation take place. Such a relationship introduces limits, a set of rules that condition emergent behaviour but encourage investigation, a space or a “dynamic medium in which premises will flow into consequences, and above all a common medium that can be contributed to and experimented with by all”[2].
            </p>
            <p>
              The dynamic relationship between an environment and its surrounding, evolving processes reminds of Maturana’s concept of structural coupling, where a medium and a system evolve together and the importance of (recursive) structural change to their recurrent interactions[3]. Living systems change in interaction with developments of their medium but also with respect to their own state and potential disintegration. Blocking behaviours follows a similar path where the context/medium is designed to evolve through the interactions of disturbance and engaging with running processes. A system or environment that “seeks to develop artefacts which exist in a permanent evolving position”[4].
            </p>
            <p>The simulations developed here can be set to motion, interrupted, forced, blocked or disturbed. It is possible to understand machines as systems of interrupting flows, where the cutting of one ensures the continuity of another [5]. This simplification of interaction focused on disturbance creates audible effects but also reflects on the nature of computing where “the interrupt not only creates a break in the temporal step-by-step processing of an algorithm but also creates an opening in its ‘operational space.’“ [6].</p>
            <p>This project aims to critically examine how digital simulations can drive computer music creation through practice-based artistic research.</p>
