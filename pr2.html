            <h1>Project 2</h1>
            <p><a href="http://koenigproject.nl" target="_blank">Gottfried Michael Koenig</a></p>

            <p>This exposition forms part of the research project “Project 2 - Implementation”, which concerns a modern
              implementation of a historically important program for computer-assisted musical composition. This version
              of Project 2 is made at <a href="https://www.koncon.nl">The Royal Conservatoire</a> and <a
                href="http://www.sonology.org">Institute of Sonology</a> in 2020–21.</p>

            <p>Gottfried Michael Koenig, born in 1926 in Magdeburg, Germany, was the first director and later chairman
              of the Institute of Sonology at Utrecht University. During this period the Institute acquired a worldwide
              reputation, particularly for its annual Sonology course. Koenig also lectured extensively in the
              Netherlands and other countries and developed his computer programs Project 1, Project 2 and SSP, designed
              to formalise the composition of musical structure-variants.</p>

            <p>The computer program Project 2 (PR2) extended some of the ideas introduced with Project 1. The aim was to
              give the composer greater control over the composition process and implementation started in 1965.
              Although several attempts have been made to complete a version of the program, there is no working version
              that exists today. This research project concerns implementing Project 2, based on recent specifications
              by Koenig and with his invaluable assistance and input.</p>

            <p>Project 2 was intended as a ‘composing program’ for instrumental music that creates ‘variants’ of a
              compositional model based on input data provided by a composer.</p>

            <p>The input data includes:</p>

            <p>Instrument: lists of instrument names; each melody or percussion instrument is defined in terms of its
              pitch, duration and dynamic range.</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Rhythm:</strong> lists for entry delays, durations, rests and tempi.
              <br> <strong>Harmony:</strong> a choice of three harmonic principles: chord list, row, interval table.
              <br> <strong>Dynamics:</strong> list of dynamic indications.
              <br> <strong>Articulation:</strong> list of articulation modes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The flow of data from the list into the score is effectuated in all the parameters, with the exception
              of Harmony, by way of ‘tables’. A table contains ‘groups’, a group contains any number of elements from
              the appropriate list. Table groups for an ensemble and group elements for the score are selected by
              various methods: arbitrary selection (Alea), serial i.e. non-repetitive selection (Series), weighted
              selection (Ratio), selection with group repetition (Group), directionally defined selection (Tendency) and
              the composer’s own selection of individual elements (Sequence).
            </p>

            <p>The parameters are hierarchically interdependent so as to avoid conflict between a subordinate and a
              superordinate parameter. Hierarchy is composer-defined or random. Data input is made by means of data
              screens on which a parameter can be described with regard to its data and data selection. The composition
              process is autonomous, i.e. without the intervention of the composer. The generated score tables can be
              printed, saved or played back via MIDI.
            </p>

            <p>What follows are discussions with Koenig and Darien Brito (the developer of the current version). Project
              2 is then introduced in more detail including the screens it consists of and a video that demonstrates how
              it works.

            <p>The initial implementation of Project 2 started in 1965. Although several
              attempts have been made to complete a working version of the program, no finished version exists today.
              What makes you want to complete the program now and what has led you to work on it again?</p>
            <p><strong>BG:</strong> Project 2 was available in several working versions; still in 1992 I
              have realised two compositions with it (<em>Concerti e
                Corali</em> and <em>60
                Bl&auml;tter</em>). Later, after purchasing a new computer and
              installing a different operating system (until well into the 90s PR2 ran under DOS), the program was out
              of order, a new version was not completed. I regret this, because I would like to continue using it
              myself; I also know of colleagues who used to own the program and who probably have to do without it for
              the same or similar reasons as I do. The new version I mentioned is based on plans with Rainer Wehinger;
              it should run under Windows and use a graphical UI for input. These plans form the basis of today's
              project.</p>
            <p><strong>GMK:</strong>Project 2 has occupied me for 55 years. It was designed shortly
              after the completion of Project 1. Both programs went back to discussions held in Darmstadt in 1951 and
              since 1954 the work in the electronic studio of the WDR. I consider them to be part of my compositional
              production, they are closely related to my work in music theory. It is my wish to make available not
              only Project 1, which is available in a working SuperCollider version, but also the theoretical content
              underlying Project 2 to interested parties in the form of an executable program. The reason for the
              resumption was a common plan of Rainer Wehinger and me to produce new versions of PR1 and PR2 based on
              the experiences which had be made with them in the meantime. This plan, drawn up in 1992, went back to a
              summer seminar dedicated to the programs, which was organised by Erhard Karkoschka and Rainer Wehinger
              in 1987 at the Hochschule f&uuml;r Musik in Stuttgart. The execution of the plan was delayed many times,
              but culminated finally in the new version of PR1 by Wehinger in 2015. It was also he who, after Luc
              D&ouml;bereiner had given up his work on a new PR2, returned to work on PR2 until personal reasons
              prevented him from continuing work at the end of 2019.</p>
            <p><strong>BG:</strong> Could you perhaps tell us about these &lsquo;experiences&rsquo; you
              are referring to that led you to planning the versions with Wehinger, but also about the different
              versions and development projects and if they have in any way influenced the functionality of the
              current implementation?</p>
            <p><strong>GMK:</strong> I did not mean any specific experiences that could be named. But
              there is the daily occupation, the daily thinking, the composing with the program, which gives a certain
              flexibility. What was once a problem becomes a solution, a looseness in dealing with theoretical
              principles and their practicsl consequences. When the plan for a new (and definitive) version was drawn
              up, it was based on the so-called Atari version, for which a complete manual from 1990 is available.
              According to the note on the title page it was &ldquo;commissioned and supported by the Sonology
              Department at the Royal Conservatory, The Hague, and carried out by Ram&oacute;n Gonz&aacute;lez-Arroyo
              and Gottfried Michael Koenig&rdquo;. If there has been any involvement with Project 2 at the Institute
              since then, it can only have been based on the Atari version. The last attempt was that of Luc
              D&ouml;bereiner, and when he graduated, Rainer Wehinger, who had just completed the SuperCollider
              version of Project 1, agreed to create a SuperCollider version of Project 2 as well. The plans I made
              for this were based on the original version from the 1960s as well as on preparations for Project 3 (cf.
              Gottfried Michael Koenig, <em>&Auml;sthetische Praxis: Texte zur
                Musik</em>, vol. 3, pp. 315-331), which did not come to
              fruition. So there is a jump between the Atari version and the current one.</p>
            <p><strong>BG:</strong> It is quite unique to work on an implementation of a software system
              that was initially designed 55 years ago. For the current implementation, you have been very active in
              specifying the functionality, verifying the calculations and working closely together with Darien Brito
              (the developer) in making sure the implementation proceeds as expected. How do you see the differences
              in the development process now compared to the first version or those that have been done since and do
              you feel there has been a need to adapt any of the original ideas to how things are done now?</p>
            <p><strong>GMK:</strong> The first version was written in ALGOL 60 and ran under DOS with a
              minimal memory by today's standards. Therefore, the program had to be broken down into several parts
              that communicated with each other via a hard disk. The input data was entered on a punched tape after it
              had been produced with a Teletype teleprinter. The &lsquo;input set&rsquo; consisted of 63 questions,
              which had to be answered completely and in the correct order. The standard format for a parameter such
              as Entry Delay consisted of List, Table, Group and Order; there was no Change of Order. Variants of a
              basic structure could be formed, but there was no decomposition of the structure into layers. The score
              data was output on a punched tape that could be printed on the Teletype. A change in the usage of the
              programme resulted from the introduction of the screen. There were also affordable desktops for private
              use. For these (and for the purpose of a general revision of the program, which, for example, concerned
              data input using keyboard and mouse) Ram&oacute;n Gonz&aacute;lez-Arroyo wrote in 1990 an ATARI version.
              In 2014 Wehinger suggested to me to design a Windows version with a graphical user interface of PR1 and
              PR2. I was already working on a version in Turbo Pascal, which remained unfinished and was replaced by a
              version in Visual Basic in 2015. The work was hard for me, so I was very happy when Wehinger, after Luc
              D&ouml;bereiner had left The Hague, was able to start realising his proposal, until signs of aging began
              to hinder him as well. While thinking about a new &ndash; and definitive &ndash; version, PR3 came to my
              mind. Under this name I had been planning a new program since the late 1980s that would solve problems
              that had remained unrecognized or neglected in PR1 and PR2. It is about the irreversible direction of
              time in music and the interdependence of parameters. In PR1, apart from the dependence of the chord size
              on the index of the Entry Delay list, there is no dependence defined, while the time direction remains
              completely untreated. In PR2 the time direction can be taken into account with the Tendency function,
              while the dependence of the parameters on each other is expressed in their Hierarchy, i.e. the order in
              which they are decided upon. PR3 should primarily consider the time direction. For this purpose, the
              composer could create a collection of &lsquo;states&rsquo; which, linked in many ways by
              &lsquo;transition functions&rsquo;, would characterise each form section by the transition between two
              states. The work of an international working group began in 1989, but had to be abandoned in 1990 due to
              financing problems. [More about PR3 in: Gottfried Michael Koenig, <em><span
                  style="font-weight: 400;">&Auml;sthetische Praxis: Texte zur Musik</em><span
                style="font-weight: 400;">, vol. 3, pp. 315-331, and vol. 4, pp.171-175]. Thinking of PR3 had two main
                effects on the redesign of PR2. In order to enable more consideration of the direction of time, the
                Tendency functions have now been made available to all parameters. The interdependence of the parameters
                is expressed in the Hierarchy of parameters. It is based on the assumption that not all parameters are
                equally involved in the design of a unit of form and that &ndash; because of the interdependence of the
                parameters &ndash; those most involved in the typification must be designed as freely as possible; hence
                their preferred position at the top of the hierarchy. These ideas, which have led to the planning of a
                new (definitive) version of PR2, are still waiting to be realised, work, however, is currently underway.
                I see no reason at present to change or extend this concept.</p>
            <p><strong>BG:</strong> You mention both the operating system and programming languages that
              have been used in previous implementations. The current implementation is done using the Python
              programming language with important consequences regarding the data structures of the program but also
              for interface elements and usability. What has been your experience of the current technical environment
              and do you think it has influenced the work and exchange of ideas in any way?</p>
            <p><strong>GMK:</strong> I cannot say much about Python. According to my experiences with
              Fortran, Algol, Turbo Pascal and VisualBasic, Project 2 does not have very high requirements. The first
              part consists of 10 questionnaires with text entries, checkboxes and radio buttons, the second part
              consists of data comparison and data storage. I found this confirmed by the ease with which Rainer
              Wehinger carried out his development work on three platforms. I am receiving updates from Darien Brito
              every fortnight, which are not revealing any conveniences or difficulties in using Python. When
              designing the graphical user interface I had the impression that it would have been more comfortable
              with Visual Basic, but I can be wrong. I don't feel that I am in any way influenced by the new
              circumstances; I am only concerned with making a concept accessible that has occupied me for 55 years,
              albeit slightly modified by new insights.</p>
            <p><strong>BG:</strong> For the new version of Project 2 an important goal has been to ensure
              that the program becomes accessible to those interested. It will be possible to download the program but
              also to access the source code. How do you envision the scope of Project 2 in terms of the original
              ideas that you have refined over many years (and are very much part of your compositional thinking)
              versus having other people use it and perhaps even extend it?</p>
            <p><strong>GMK:</strong> I can say little about how other users use it. PR2 has not become
              known to many composers due to the relatively short time in which the program was functional and due to
              certain difficulties of its transmission (in the first years there was no internet). PR1, on the other
              hand, was more easily and continuously accessible, and it was also dealt with more intensively in
              lessons at the Institute for Sonology. Therefore, to this day, I still receive questions about the
              password to download it from my website. PR2 was more likely to attract the attention of composers,
              musicologists and university seminars interested in theory, who were able to study the program without
              wanting to compose with it. I am thinking, for example, of Otto Laske, who has dealt extensively with
              PR1 and PR2 in theory [see &ldquo;Composition Theory in Koenig's Project One and Project Two&rdquo;, in:
              <em>The Music Machine</em>
              (ed. Curtis Roads, pp. 119-130)], but also practically through many works composed with PR1 and PR2 (a
              string quartet). I'm also thinking of student seminars and practical exercises at the universities in
              Essen and Stuttgart in which I was involved. Particular attention has been paid to the Tendency function
              by Barry Truax, who was inspired by it for his POD programs, apparently having been inspiring a graphic
              designer I met in Vancouver who, as he told me himself, based his computer works solely on it. I have
              discussed PR2 a lot with other composers, especially when they were involved in the coding (like
              Ram&oacute;n Gonz&aacute;lez-Arroyo or David Theriault), and have been inspired to the details. They did
              not make any changes themselves, and that a future user should interfere with the rather complex
              structure of the computer code seems unlikely to me.
            </p>
            <p><strong>BG:</strong> Clearly, many of the ideas have served or inspired others. I&rsquo;m
              curious about the difference in accessibility compared to PR2. Has the fact that PR2 was not as known or
              used by as many been on your mind and somehow motivated you to work on it now again?</p>
            <p><strong>GMK:</strong> PR2 has always been my problem child. In the Institute, PR1 was
              treated first, then, if there was time left, PR2 as well. This meant that the program received less
              attention. It was also handicapped by its size, because of the small memory it had to be divided into
              four independent programs, which communicated with each other via the hard disk. Due to these
              circumstances, only a few composers were able to work with it. Porting it to new hardware and
              translating it into other computer languages also hindered its development and popularity. Reasons
              enough to welcome every opportunity to work out a complete version that is in line with the experience
              gained so far.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>BG:</strong> The current Project 2 implementation was founded on the base of
              interface sketches (or prototypes) that you have done yourself and through which you communicated the
              main design of the program. However, the original version used a very different approach to user input,
              where multiple questions had to be answered before output was generated based on those answers. Can you
              explain how your ideas regarding user input have evolved and how the input interfaces in the current
              version came about? Also, even though the new interface consists of many modern UI elements, there is a
              strong preference for the typing of all input values. Why do you find that so important?</p>
            <p><strong>GMK:</strong> The ideas have not changed, only the technical possibilities of
              presenting them. The composer should be able to tell the program his wishes, limited of course to those
              which the program could fulfil. To save the composer from having to leaf through the manual, and once
              the punched tape had been replaced by a text monitor, the range of executable actions was shown on the
              screen in the form of menus in which one could scroll through and finally answer questions, i.e. type in
              the data. The graphical interface allows the user to work in a different way, more conveniently,
              versatilely and faster than calling up menus on a text-oriented monitor. The memory of PR3, where the
              number of parameters used should be optional, gave me the idea to allow the PR2 user to be free in the
              number of parameters, so that &ndash; maybe just for experimenting or studying the program &ndash; he no
              longer needs to define all parameters. Typing as such is not important. In all cases where the user has
              to decide among a fixed number of alternatives, he only needs to click on a check button or radio button
              anyway. Data, on the other hand, which are unpredictable in type and number, can best be entered by
              typing text. For fast and comfortable data entry, it is best to keep both hands in the same position on
              the keyboard. I see the monitor screen as a kind of notepad on which the user takes notes, deletes them,
              changes them, because this is the place where the composition takes place.</p>
            <p><strong>BG:</strong> Working with Project 2 involves different working phases. First, the
              input phase takes place where all entered data is extensively checked to ensure it is
              &lsquo;correct&rsquo; and that it can be used for the important next step, the production phase. I
              believe the development process of the current program has also reflected this, where the work on the
              production phase was not started until all of the tests had been implemented and carefully executed.
              Could you explain why there is such an emphasis on the precise validation of all the data and tests of
              the input phase? Was there a comparable focus on this aspect also in the other implementations that have
              been done?</p>
            <p>Input phase and Production phase are two independent units. In the input
              phase, parameter values and combining rules are typed in. In the production phase these data are used to
              compose one or more score tables. Since the composition is largely chance-based, the production phase
              must be able to rely on the data being combined according to the rules without any problems. For this
              reason, the data must be checked thoroughly. This is done automatically before entering the production
              phase. However, the user can have his data tested already in the input phase. Such tests have existed
              since the first program version in 1967.</p>
            <p><strong>BG:</strong> In some sense this does emphasize the importance of starting from
              clear and well-defined input material. I believe this attitude can be seen in many of your works
              including the electronic music. Could you tell us how the process of creating musical form using PR2
              takes place and how you understand the relationship between material and form as a result of using the
              program?</p>
            <p><strong>GMK:</strong> What is musical form anyway? Form is usually spoken of in terms of
              timeless experiences, form usually refers to constant properties. Form is described by the
              classification of form types. This gives the impression that the composer chooses a form type and then,
              as the speech goes, fills it with a &lsquo;content&rsquo;. At the latest since serial writing, form is
              something that is created through formative work, an evolving content whose boundary to non-form gives
              an outline that, when the content that has formed it is removed, remains as form. Form as a process of
              creation is experienced by the composer as well as the listener. Seen in this light, form is not
              predetermined as something to be realised with PR2, but the result of a process in which continuity and
              discontinuity complement each other. The most important instrument for creating form in PR2 are
              therefore the sieve functions, which define the individual events and manage their temporal
              concatenation.</p>
            <p><strong>Discussing the program with Gottfried Michael Koenig</strong></p>
            <p><strong>BG:</strong> Project 2 extends some of your previous work on Project 1 from 1964.
              It seems the aim was to give the composer a greater control over the composition process. What was it in
              particular that brought you to Project 2 initially and how does the program differ from Project
              1?</p>
            <p><strong>GMK:</strong> It was not so much a question of more control over the production
              process, which was largely characterised by random decisions, but rather of expanding the processes.
              However, it was desirable to extend control by adding more control instruments. The reason for designing
              PR2, very soon after the completion of PR1, was the insight that more could be said about the
              description of musical structures and their interrelationships than PR1 allowed. After all, PR1 had only
              been a first attempt, an ambitious exercise in a programming course. Although the application
              possibilities of PR1 were surprisingly large, many wishes remained unfulfilled. The programming exercise
              was to become an &lsquo;adult&rsquo; system, not only as a composition aid, but also as a tool for
              research in the field of composition theory. The differences between PR1 and PR2 are easy to specify.
              There are more parameters, for the parameters larger ranges of values and more design possibilities
              through refined selection procedures (sieve functions), creation of variants. While PR1 could only
              generate a rough data grid, which had to be analysed and translated into a playable score afterwards, in
              PR2 instruments should be able to be defined and dependencies of the parameters on each other should
              already be considered by the program, which in PR1 was a subsequent task of the composer. In short: the
              question of the programmability of music should be asked more sharply and answered more
              meticulously.</p>
            <p><strong>BG:</strong> Do you think that including the instrument definition and the
              restrictions that it implies on other aspects of the generation process will influence the work realised
              with the program in a different way compared to the output of PR1?</p>
            <p><strong>GMK:</strong> The difference is considerable. In PR1 there are only a small number
              of instruments (originally 9), which could be interpreted (even ignored) later on in any way on the
              basis of the printed score tables. In PR2 (if this parameter is active at all) it can be the first
              parameter in the Hierarchy to determine everything, as most other parameters are more or less restricted
              in their mobility by the Instrument definitions. Conversely, if Instrument is only at the end of the
              Hierarchy, this parameter must adapt to all previous ones, whereby its autonomy, the ability to develop
              according to its own compositional principle, can be severely restricted. But even in PR2, the
              instruments can be left undefined or only partially defined, so that the influence of the Instrument
              parameter on the composition depends entirely on how the composer is using it.</p>
            <p><strong>BG:</strong> Project 2 allows for realizing variants of a compositional model
              based on the same input data. Structure variants are perhaps one of the core ideas behind the program
              and also your piece <em>&Uuml;bung f&uuml;r
                Klavier</em> (1969&ndash;70). Could you explain why these
              structural variants are important to you and what it is that Project 2 offers for exploring them?
            </p>
            <p><strong>GMK:</strong> The creation of variants has always been a familiar process to me
              from electronic sound production. They are created by transposition, filtering and reverberation of
              sound sequences recorded on tape. They are a welcome derivation process because they change certain
              sound characteristics while others remain unchanged. In this way, precisely defined relationships
              between sound passages can be established, which is of great importance for the shaping of the form. It
              is worth noting the difference to a variation, which is carefully &lsquo;invented&rsquo; by the
              composer, not mechanically derived. By the way, the mechanical (and therefore extremely fast) creation
              of variations was already possible with PR1 by repeating the composition process with a different
              starting number for the random generator. PR2 goes a step further in this respect, e.g. by automatically
              changing the selection processes that are important for the design of the form, and much more. Variant
              creation is not only useful for experimental purposes, but also for the composer, who uses it to create
              and characterize form units. Variant creation is actually nothing more than one of the many instruments
              for form development.</p>
            <p><strong>BG:</strong> Can you tell us something about the use of variants in your own
              compositions and how they have contributed to the creation of it?</p>
            <p><strong>GMK:</strong> A variant results when alternative decisions are made, different
              values are used, under the same structural conditions. Although not unknown in classical form analysis,
              it is almost inevitable in the mechanised generation of sound and structure. Every filtering or
              transposition of a sound sequence on tape produces a variant. Variants are an ideal vehicle for the
              generation of form by changing the given without losing the relation to the origin. This also applies to
              the time dimension by compressing (shortening) or stretching (lengthening) the model. The formation of
              form in my electronic compositions such as <em>Klangfiguren
                II</em> or <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essay</em>, also the series of
              <em>Segments</em> for
              changing instrumental groups is due to the work with variants. Due to the convenience and speed of their
              generation, variants are suitable for studying the structural &lsquo;environment&rsquo; of a structural
              model. The composer can choose the most suitable variant for his or her purposes from several variants
              or base the development of the form on variants.
            </p>
            <p><strong>BG:</strong> Parameters in Project 2 are calculated within a hierarchy and can
              have a specified relation where a main parameter conditions a supporting one. For example, the
              instrument parameter has a strong influence on others and how it is positioned seems an important choice
              for the user of the program. Why is it necessary to establish such a parameter hierarchy when that was
              not part of Project 1? Furthermore, how do you think the interdependence between the parameters
              influences the music created with the program and how Project 2 is used?</p>
            <p><strong>GMK:</strong> You need them, because parameters are always in a hierarchy in that
              they are perceived by the listener to varying degrees. Their hierarchy is deliberately used by composers
              to achieve certain effects (by means of distinctive rhythm, harmony, volume, instrumentation, etc.). PR1
              was, in the words of Otto Laske, a &ldquo;flash of inspiration&rdquo;, not the fruit of long reflection.
              The parameters were simply worked out in a fixed order; whether the resulting context was also
              &lsquo;playable&rsquo; should be decided by the composer, who still had to translate the score tables
              into a score. I do not believe that dependence as such produces any particular effect. It is rather a
              question of the compositional intention and how to realise it. If the effect of a certain sequence of
              events depends on the shaping of a certain parameter, it is better to determine the relationship of the
              involved parameters to each other from the outset rather than wait for a happy sequence of random
              values. Nothing is easier, by the way, than to change the Hierarchy in PR2, to leave it completely or
              partially to chance, in order to experience the effect of the Hierarchy experimentally. In order to work
              with PR2, one must know its possibilities and have a conception that can be realised with the help of
              given algorithms. Familiarisation is made easier by experimenting with each individual parameter &ndash;
              i.e. data and their treatment &ndash; and listen to the result immediately with MIDI. You can also keep
              the result of a program run and add another parameter. To elaborate a concept, all possibilities of
              layer and variant formation are available; each stage can be viewed on the screen, listened to with
              MIDI, saved and reloaded.</p>
            <p><strong>BG:</strong> You mention the parameters as always existing in a hierarchy that is
              perceivable by the listener to varying degrees. How do you understand the relationship between a
              listener and the musical parameters and how does that relationship exist within PR2?</p>
            <p><strong>GMK:</strong> Parameters are in a hierarchy because you cannot select them at the
              same time. The fact that they are decided on one after the other does not make them interdependent, but
              rather gives the user of PR2 the opportunity to determine their interdependence. This is done on the one
              hand by the order in which the data selection takes place, on the other hand by defining or leaving open
              the relationship. PR2 also offers to leave the hierarchy to chance and to experimentally experience
              different effects in the way of variants. When listening to music, the listener has an overall
              experience where he hardly consciously distinguishes between different parameters. Nevertheless, he is
              susceptible to drastic effects, each triggered by certain parameters: increases in speed or volume,
              strong contrasts and smooth transitions, changes between different instrument groups, etc. Composers
              like to use this sensitivity of the listener for their musical rhetoric.</p>
            <p><strong>BG:</strong> In order to create higher-level structures with Project 2 an
              important idea is the one of selection. A composer selects values for parameters to use in a composition
              and applies selection principles to choose from those values how and when they occur in time. Out of the
              provided selection principles, only one addresses directly any changes in time, the Tendency principle.
              This method performs a random selection between boundaries that are changing in time and through these
              temporal changes, shapes and clear movements can be produced. Could you share your thoughts on the
              special characteristics of the tendency mask and how it is different from the other selection
              processes?</p>
            <p><strong>GMK:</strong> The peculiarity of the Tendency principle is that it does not know a
              cycle. The rule according to which data are selected is only exhausted at the end of the Structure
              Duration. However, partial tendencies can be defined so that a closer relationship to the database
              (Ensemble) is created. The Tendency principle differs from other selection processes in that it enables
              different applications. Alea provides random results, Ratio allows deviations from the repetition
              prohibition, Group generates a group-wise repetition of data, with Sequence a data string can only be
              repeated, not changed. The Tendency principle is more dependent than the others on the arrangement of
              the data in the Ensemble, because the Tendency mask only makes accessible a section of the Ensemble and
              applies the Alea principle to the &lsquo;visible&rsquo; data.</p>
            <p><strong>BG:</strong> How did you arrive at this set of selection processes and has it ever
              occurred to you to include more processes in addition to these mentioned above?</p>
            <p><strong>GMK:</strong> The sieve functions more or less resulted by themselves. As an
              exercise in the computer course at the University of Bonn I had already written programs for twelve-tone
              series and all-interval series. Therefore Alea and Series were used as a basis for the data selection in
              PR1. For PR2 I wanted to bridge the area between regularity and irregularity systematically by using
              intermediary steps. This resulted in Ratio (for the relaxation of the repetition prohibition) and Group
              (for a better structure of the form). Much is owed to the ongoing discussion with Stockhausen, whose
              orchestral work at the time was not called &ldquo;Gruppen&rdquo; for nothing. (Stockhausen had met the
              mathematician Andreas Speiser, who had written a &ldquo;Theory of Groups of Finite Order&rdquo; in 1922,
              during a holiday stay in Switzerland. Speiser visited us in
              Cologne soon after). The Tendency principle finally resulted from the difficulty of composing
              goal-oriented passages with the means of serial thinking. At that time I had indeed toyed with the idea
              of developing more sieve functions, but no opportunity, not even necessity, has ever arisen for
              this.</p>
            <p><strong>BG:</strong> In your article from 1969, &ldquo;Programmed Music &ndash; From the
              Composer's Viewpoint&rdquo; you write about Project 2 and mention that in &ldquo;Utrecht we have
              developed a comprehensive structure program [Project 2] which is primarily intended for instrumental
              composition. It is supposed to help the composer empirically to understand the concept of musical
              structure and to find an answer to the question: what in music is programmable?&rdquo; The goal of
              Project 2 seems to be somehow general here and this even suggests that the program can respond to such
              questions in different ways. Do you think the above statement still holds for the current version and if
              so, what is it about the principles behind the program that allows for exploring &ldquo;what in music is
              programmable?&rdquo;</p>
            <p><strong>GMK:</strong> The quote refers to a course in which mainly PR1 was discussed and
              made available to participants for their own experiments. PR2 was also discussed in theory, but only
              independent versions of the selection processes were available for practical exercises. This is what is
              meant by the term &lsquo;comprehensive structure&rsquo;. The question (what is programmable?) is
              answered in the quoted article: &ldquo;Everything the composer knows about music. ... What does the
              composer know about himself when he composes? ... He must be aware of his habits and criteria. Not until
              he knows what he wants and what he will want and that decisions he has to make now are rationally
              related to those that have to be made later can he start the program.&rdquo; The question would
              therefore be whether the program could serve the composer to reassure himself of his own understanding
              of structure, and otherwise, when considering music analytically, to consider above all its structure
              and what is programmable &ndash; i.e. describable &ndash; by it. Understood in this way, the statement
              still applies to the present version. The merit of facilitating the study of the programmability of
              musical structures is not due to Project 2 but to the computer technology. Computers make it possible to
              realise even complex structural contexts in a matter of seconds, so that the composer can dare to wait
              for answers he would previously not have asked.</p>
            <p><br /></p>
            <hr>
            <p><strong>With Darien Brito</strong></p>
            <p><strong>BG:</strong> The initial work of Project 2 (PR2) started 55 years ago and there
              have been several versions that have implemented the core ideas of the program. How have you experienced
              working on them again now and the close collaboration with Gottfried Michael Koenig?</p>
            <p><strong>DB:</strong>Project 2 embodies a particular take on rules for music that have had
              important cultural and technological repercussions. This has been a wonderful opportunity to know and
              understand on a deeper level the tradition of computer-assisted composition.</p>
            <p><strong>BG:</strong> Koenig&rsquo;s technical and philosophical contributions to this
              tradition have always been palpable, so It has been truly a privilege for me to engage first-hand with
              notions that I heard echoed by my teachers, when I was doing my studies. In that sense, it feels like an
              important responsibility, given that I feel like a mediator between Koenig and a language that keeps
              evolving.</p>
            <p><strong>DB:</strong> The task has not been easy at all because Project 2 is the fruit of a
              very personal way of thinking. The clarity of its formulation and definitions leaves little space to
              changes. Some decisions in the design are very idiosyncratic, so they do not always correspond to
              current schemes of computer programming, or even how we are now used to interact with software.
              Nonetheless, it was important to preserve all its features in the interest of having the implementation
              as close as possible to the source.</p>
            <p><strong>BG:</strong> The current implementation started with quite clear specifications
              and even interface prototypes made by Koenig himself. How has the development process been in terms of
              the definition but also verification of the core principles that you have implemented?</p>
            <p><strong>DB:</strong> The given definitions take place over a number of distinct and clear
              steps. The first and most complicated step is the validation of the input data. This process needs to
              ensure that everything entered can produce a valid output and has no conflicting information, before any
              calculation or processing takes place.</p>
            <p>Verifying that this is done in the right way has been complicated for
              various reasons, not in the least because of Koenig&rsquo;s decision to keep every input data-type as
              text. This is one of such idiosyncratic features that I mentioned before.</p>
            <p>To understand why that complicates things quite a bit let us imagine we
              are trying to check if a certain number is in the valid range for a given input. Say that the acceptable
              range for that input are numbers from 1 to 5. The user enters &lsquo;3&rsquo;. In order to perform this
              check, that input must first be converted to a numeric value, since its inputted as a string data-type.
              However, that input has an extra space after the three, inputted perhaps by accident, so the program
              also has to strip down invalid characters before it can convert it to a number, and check if the entered
              value is valid.</p>
            <p>As we can see, such a simple check involved some labour already. This
              increases drastically if the task becomes more complicated, or if the input possibilities are larger. If
              the input would be numeric already to start with, as it is the case with every modern set of
              user-interface tools, we could have saved us quite some work. However, the specification for Project 2
              says that every input must be a string. That decision was kept because of how Koenig wishes to interact
              with the program.</p>
            <p>So, in order to achieve full verification of core principles we needed to
              be quite thorough with every single input, since I could not rely on pre-made number boxes or matrices
              to make all the checking for us. It became quite important to have a rather robust error-checking
              mechanism. Koenig provided a set of checklists for that purpose, which I tested against test inputs for
              every object and used in detail to write all the data validation algorithms. A great amount of time has
              been devoted to this particular aspect, and we are still working on some details.</p>
            <p><strong>BG:</strong> An important goal of this implementation project has been to make the
              current version of Project 2 available and accessible to all those interested. What is that you have
              done during development to ensure this and in what ways do you think the program and the source code
              could be useful for others?</p>
            <p><strong>DB:</strong>The most important decision on this regard was the choice of Python as a
              programming language. Even though many different languages or environments could have been suitable, we
              wanted to employ a platform that would be easily expandable, readable and accessible.</p>
            <p>During the last ten years Python has gained a considerable traction in
              every field, given its ease of use and native support as a scripting language in various host programs.
              It is very easy to quickly set up Python in any machine and it is a very well supported language, which
              warranties that programs written with it will be able to run for a long time.</p>
            <p>All the code is stored in an online repository as open-source, so that
              anyone can access it, download it and even modify it. It can also run as a cross-platform executable. I
              believe that this is the best way to ensure that Koenig&rsquo;s ideas are alive and can be
              employed.</p>
            <p><strong>BG:</strong> Some of the specifications of PR2 does seem to be influenced by the
              technical possibilities (and obstacles) that existed during the implementation of previous PR2 versions.
              Has the implementation now of some of the core ideas been different from the specs due to the
              differences they take in a modern programming language such as Python and if so, how has that
              been?</p>
            <p><strong>DB:</strong> Most definitely. I have observed (sometimes with astonishment) how
              complicated certain operations had to be thought out. I assume this was due to memory limitations on
              available computers at the time when seminal ideas of Project 2 were being developed.</p>
            <p>This has been fascinating to learn since it reveals the ingenuity of the
              composer/programmer in trying to solve a given task that we now take for granted. Such design had
              naturally an impact on how the program was conceived and modelled, producing a logic structure that felt
              rather unnatural to me, specially at the beginning, since I am only familiar with modern programming
              paradigms.</p>
            <p>To give an example: in Project 2, accessing lists in random order without
              repeating values is an important operation. This can take place with some variants. In its simplest
              form, it consists of having a collection of numbers and taking one element at a time without
              repetitions, until there are no elements left. Once the task is completed the list regenerates itself.
              In the original specification, this is achieved by flipping the indexes of the items in the list so that
              one that has been used is moved down the stack while its index becomes inaccessible, by decreasing a
              counter.</p>
            <p>The logic to create this algorithm is rather convoluted for what we would
              now consider to be a rather simple operation. This whole mechanism has been replaced by a single line of
              code that shuffles the array instead, and creates a Python &lsquo;generator&rsquo;, which can be
              accessed at will using lazy evaluation and regenerated when finished. There are various such adaptations
              that have taken place in the program, naturally with the approval of Koenig.</p>
            <p><strong>BG:</strong> PR2 consists of ideas that are very important to Koenig and that he
              has refined over many years. Is there anything you could share about the process of working on the
              implementation of such a personal program and what you, (also an active artist) have learned during the
              process?</p>
            <p><strong>DB:</strong> The structure of Project 2 favours the generation of scores via
              carefully designed series of rules and steps in the algorithmic decision-making process, instead of
              putting too much weight on the personal decisions of the composer. This resonates strongly with my own
              artistic activity, which is based on algorithmic systems and generative processes for the creation of
              audiovisuals. The chance of knowing and working so down to the details on Koenig&rsquo;s system has been
              an all-inspiring experience since it has forced me to re-evaluate my own notions and to re-live moments
              that perhaps Koenig went through, in trying to put his ideas into practice.</p>
            <p>On a practical level, perhaps one of the most important lessons I got
              from it is the power of combinatorics. I have some experience creating systems with machine learning or
              with biologically-inspired algorithms. However, it has been remarkable and surprising to me to see how a
              carefully crafted set of combinations and permutations based on a succinct strict set of numbers can
              produce already so much useful richness, without the need of much more complexity.</p>
            <p>I am overall very moved by the passion that Koenig displays whenever we
              are working together. I believe it is a rare quality to possess, even after so many years of
              creation.<br /></p>

            <p>The plans for [&ldquo;Project 1&rdquo; and] &ldquo;Project 2&rdquo; date
              back to the Cologne period. The two projects are fundamentally different. The first one is designed to
              be &lsquo;vertical&rsquo; in a sense, in that several individually calculated &lsquo;layers&rsquo;
              overlap in the result. The second, in contrast, is &lsquo;horizontal&rsquo; in that only states that are
              already complex in themselves follow one another. In other words: in the first project, each musical
              date must take into account what is happening at the same time, in the second, what happened before. One
              can call simultaneity the musical &lsquo;space&rsquo;, since it is, so to speak, perpendicular to time;
              the pure sequence, however, is spaceless. Physically, music is indeed spaceless in time, while the
              listener (and before that, the composer) breaks down the sensory perception into qualitatively different
              dimensions. This leads to the question: how can the qualitatively perceived space of music be
              transformed into the time sequence of physical states? This question arose together with Stockhausen's
              article in the third &ldquo;Reihe&rdquo;, not yet so definitively formulated, but still in essence. But
              the question only becomes acute, it seems to me, when the musical event is &lsquo;programmed&rsquo;,
              i.e. brought into a general form. A separate department is to be set up within our studio at the
              university for preliminary acoustic and audiopsychological investigations; investigations on the side of
              perception are to provide prerequisites for the programming of electronic sounds, investigations on the
              side of aesthetic perception are to provide prerequisites for the programming of composition-theoretical
              statements.</p>
            <p>[Letter to Ulricht Dibelius, 30.5.1965]</p>
            <p>In addition, I am working on a PROJECT 2, which has been fixed in its
              conception for a long time and is now being fixed in detail. I have called the difference between the
              two projects &lsquo;vertical&rsquo; and &lsquo;horizontal&rsquo; conception. By &lsquo;vertical
              conception&rsquo; I understand the composition of the musical course of events from superimposed
              &lsquo;layers&rsquo; (&lsquo;voices&rsquo; in the instrumental area, individual tapes in electronic
              music, which are synchronised with each other, &lsquo;parameters&rsquo; in the serial composition
              technique, which are individually fixed and then also &lsquo;superimposed&rsquo;). The vertical
              conception thus describes, in a sense, a musical &lsquo;space&rsquo; that is perpendicular to musical
              time, that which is qualitatively different at any given moment. In terms of production, this space is
              realised in instrumental music through the use of several musicians, in electronic music through tapes
              that run simultaneously, in terms of composition through the idea of parameters, and in the listening
              process it is the condition <em>sine qua non</em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the musical
                experience. Nevertheless, the oscillation curve of the sound
                through which the musical impression is transmitted can be described as an amplitude curve in time in
                which the components of the musical &lsquo;space&rsquo; disappear. In other words, the musical
                &lsquo;space&rsquo; (the simultaneity of different qualities of perception) can be transformed into a
                mere sequence of different amplitudes; only the musical ear reassembles the auditory image from this.
                This is what is meant by &lsquo;horizontal conception&rsquo;. It seems to make sense, for the purpose of
                producing electronic sounds with the help of a computer, to distinguish between these two approaches,
                and with some certainty the &lsquo;horizontal&rsquo; one is more appropriate to the computer. Beyond the
                pure programming technique, however, the difference described can also become significant for the formal
                constitution of music (instrumental as well as electronic). The strength (and at the same time the
                weakness) of the serial composition technique was the representation of parameters, and it can be said
                that - in most works of this phase - the simultaneous presence of different parameters was more
                important than the actual sequence of different musical states, no matter how they were constituted
                individually (and serially). Significant progress was achieved with group composition. And when I
                organise my two projects today vertically on the one hand and horizontally on the other, it is actually
                a recapitulation of the music history of the last 15 years. I think, however, that there must be clarity
                about these compositional processes before one can go any further, namely to draw the consequences. The
                two projects also reflect the relationship between determined and indeterminate structures - i.e. the
                inclusion of chance. In both projects there are on the one hand relationships determined by the
                composer, on the other hand fields of free decision, which nobody can make as unbiased as a computer. I
                have come to the conviction, which I think can be proven experimentally, that serial determination is
                merely a special case of random decision, a random decision of course within fixed limits.</p>

              On 1 September, Greta Vermeulen started working as a half-day assistant (the other half occupies
              Shinohara) to take care of all program matters and contact with the computer centre. In the meantime,
              she could hardly achieve anything (except some Flexowriter work), because the Electrologica X8 is again
              not running. Yesterday PROJECTS 1 and 2 were shipped to Amsterdam. Most likely PROJECT 2 is too long
              (for a core memory with 16000 words). I will try to squeeze the arrays together. I also have hope to
              find a bigger computer. An employee of the local IBM branch, from whom Tempelaars got manuals about
              other machine languages, showed great interest, he will visit us soon.</p>

            <p>In the next course, starting in October, I will hold a special course
              entitled &ldquo;Computer Composition&rdquo;. The course will take place three times a month and will
              consist of a series of practical exercises. For this purpose, PROJECT 2 will be taken apart into its
              individual parts, so that the participants can program and try out each piece for themselves. At the end
              of the course there will be the opportunity to use the complete version of PROJECT 2.</p>

            <p>In the special course COMPUTER COMPOSITION we had one hour per week in
              the last course. Small sub-programs (from PROJECT 2) were discussed; the participants could run these
              programs on the computer. We will do the same in the following course; in the continuation course we
              will focus more on the computer itself and the ALGOL language. The participants should write simple

            <p>4 Plans for the new version of PROJECT 2 were put on hold due to other
              events, and the computer sound program did not work as I wanted it to - again a question of time. In the
              meantime, Paul Berg has taken on the sound programme and has achieved his first small successes. Freed
              from this, I turned back to PROJECT 2 and at the same time submitted a project for the construction of a
              sound generator. This is an old idea of mine (and perhaps this is what you are aiming at with your
              remark about a &lsquo;real-time version&rsquo;) ... in order to have data points available for each of
              the operations used by the composer). The project has been provisionally accepted; Scherpenisse is
              working on a simplified version of Kaegi's VOSIM generators. &ndash; The input data points are in any
              case fixed in the user's data set, which can be interactively modified in the new version of the program
              (PROJECT 2b) and also saved on DECtape. By the way, I write the new program in FORTRAN IV, so that it
              can also run on other computers without much effort.</p>

            <p>I am now working on a new version of PROJECT 2, which will run on our own
              (private) computer. This allows me to work much faster than with the old version in the computer centre
              and gives me the opportunity to do extensive experiments and also to compose some pieces again. In the
              institute, even special generators are being built with which the structures that the computer has
              composed can be listened to immediately.</p>

            <p>At this moment, &ldquo;Project 2&rdquo; is unfortunately not yet
              available. Ram&oacute;n has almost completed the redesign (i.e. the last Sonology version without MIDI
              connection for Atari), but has gone on a search for bugs again (not without finding some) and would like
              to finish it first. This will be the case (according to his estimate) in January or February. After that
              we can send you the complete source text - as hardcopy or on 3.5&rdquo; floppy. If the implementation of
              &ldquo;Project 1&rdquo; on a Macintosh is so smooth that you think you can extend it to &ldquo;Project
              2&rdquo;, this will certainly happen. A MIDI connection is also considered of course, but we would like
              to have a better version of the &ldquo;Midas&rdquo; program. &ndash; It is possible that we
              (Ram&oacute;n and I) will produce a new, improved and extended version of &ldquo;Project 2&rdquo;;
              whether this will happen depends, among other things, on funding from The Hague Conservatory. This would
              render the current version obsolete.</p>

              Koenig composed the string trio <i>60 Blätter</i> (60 pages) for his friend Heinz-Klaus Metzger as a present for his sixtieth birthday. It consists of 60 single pages. They form four groups of 15 pages each (1–15, 16–30, 31–45, 46–60), which are variants of one another. The musicians can play any number of them (but at least 15) in any sequence. On the CD, these pieces are performed in ascending order. The listener is advised to use the Random or Program function in order to enjoy different, random-determined or planned versions of any length.
